             Tablets and mobiles are convenient, eco-friendly document readers that can carry
millions of books. Oftentimes, the reader may have to recite prayers, or read out a
bedtime story or be engaged in other activities like cooking when one’s hands are
dirty and one would like to avoid touching the phone or tablet. In such use cases,
it is useful to have a voice controlled PDF app, and even better is an intelligent
PDF app. Under the voice control feature, the PDF reader responds to commands
like “go to page 10” via the microphone and does the respective action on the PDF
viewer. On the other hand, the intelligence feature is intended for readers who
would recite the contents of the PDF aloud. For such users, it is very inconvenient
to simultaneously focus on fixing the right zoom, and location using their hands
instead of focusing on their recitation performance. An intelligent PDF reader is
envisioned to automatically scroll to the right place and provide the right level of
zoom that is comfortable to the eye. In this project we propose to address these
needs. These features need (1) Voice to text conversion, (2) PDF to text conversion,
and (3) a metric assess how close (1) and (2) match to access the location of
the PDF and zoom accordingly. However, Voice control needs only (1). As a part
of this course we successfully completed the first phase on audio recognition, and
partly implemented text recognition corresponding to second phase. We built an
app deployed it on our mobiles and tablets, and is quite accurate; 90% of times it
recognizes and does the correct action based on the command.
